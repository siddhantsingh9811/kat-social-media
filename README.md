# Trying Out React
Initially a small blog website made to try out react which somehow turned into a whole social media application

## Backend
Uses Strapi a headless CMS cause well this was gonna be a small test but stil pretty good for more compliated stuff

## Frontend
React which well idk at all
did the design in [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/7LFPbs8wLAYQpYzdJAd9eR/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)

## Hosting
The backend is hosted on digital ocean and the frontend was hosted through Vercel [here](https://kat-five.vercel.app/) However the backend is no longer hosted so functionality is limited.
